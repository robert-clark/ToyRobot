ToyRobot:
Solution available at https://github.com/robert-clark/ToyRobot.

The solution should build in Visual Studio and run as a console app.

The solution currently targets .NET Framework v4.6.1.

The test harness depends on a TestScripts directory in the application 
root folder.  The parser will pick up any files prefixed "TestCase_"
with a file extension .txt in that folder.  This directory and some 
pre-existing test cases should build with the solution.
(Add more test cases as needed.)
